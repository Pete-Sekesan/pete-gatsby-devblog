Welcome to the blog everyone. I just wanted to give myself a bit of an introduction. I am a boot camp grad in the midst of a career change to software engineering. I live in New York and when not plugging away at code, I like to workout, follow anything Disney related closely and have a toddler keeping me busy.

Back in May of 2020, my career in Events Marketing and Management came to an end due to the some mass layoffs at my company. I took the time (and severance which was certainly helpful) to re-focus a bit and decided to finally pursue my intrigue for programming into a career. I did a couple of [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) exercises and went on and did a bunch of research on remote coding boot camps and decided on [Thinkful](https://thinkful.com) for my program.

It was a pretty grueling seven months, and I would have expected nothing less considering I was basically teaching myself multiple new languages. I am happy to say I graduated (no small feat in this program apparently) and have since been plugging away at applications and some side projects.

My plan is to use this blog to offer any insights I can on this journey. I wish I had started it at the beginning of my learning, but in the grand scheme of things, it's still pretty early.
