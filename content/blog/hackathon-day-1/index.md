# Day 1!

I have to say, for not really doing any coding, Day 1 of this hackathon has been quite the success.
I will be partnering with one of my fellow study Discord study group colleague that graduated the boot camp with me.

Today we just spent the time fleshing out ideas for the card game application.

- We decided on which card game we would like to make. So as to not keep you all in suspense, we will be doing Blackjack.

- We honed in on which features were a must have to really shine.

- We discussed some edge case features that could be very **WOW** but will only be implemented time permitting.

- Allocated the hours we would be working together on it moving forward.

Now, I know you are probably saying or thinking, _"You only have 6 days left, how could you waste a day?"_
To be, this was a very productive day in that we have a nice outline of what we need to accomplish. I think once it comes down to diving into the coding tomorrow, we will have a clear path ahead of us and it was the best way to set ourselves up for success.

Famous last words, am I right?

Until next time.
