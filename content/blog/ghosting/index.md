## Or am I?

Applying for jobs in the world of software engineering is something that can be a skill completely on it's own aside from actually knowing how to properly code.
I came from a career in Marketing, and typically you put in application after application but when you heard back from someone, typically you had an interview coming your way.

Applying for a developer position, at least as a Junior is quite daunting. Here are a number of things you better have ready before hitting submit on an application:

- All the right keywords to get past that ATS scanner
- A git repository showing your code
- A portfolio site

After that you submit and hope you hear something back. When and if you do, it's another gauntlet:

- Intro/Tech Screen phone call
- A possible coding assessment assignment
- Live coding assessment
- Meeting with the team

And you know what? I get it. This isn't a career that you can kinda fake it until you make it sort of deal. You either know your stuff or know how to go about knowing it, or you don't. But what really gets to me is being ghosted.

I don't care how busy you can be as a hiring manager or recruiter. If an applicant has taken the time to apply and have had a phone call with or anything beyond that point, they deserve some closure to their application. Far too often I have had phone screens end on a great note with a discussion at the end about what the next step is what to expect in a live code or assessment only to never hear from them again. This is after a follow up emails as well. A handful of times I have even done a take home assignment only to not hear a peep. Hell, even if their response was "Wow that was the worst coding I have ever seen it's a no", I would take that. At least you aren't left in limbo. I had a breath of fresh air earlier today when an employer responded to my take home assignment. I didn't get the job, but they gave me some valuable feedback that I know can and become better with.

We need to normalize responded to applicants one way or the other. I get that not every single applicant in the hundreds that come in can get one, but if you have had a conversation with someone, do give them the courtesy. It's tough out there finding a position, especially for juniors at this time. A little respect on both sides isn't too much to ask.
