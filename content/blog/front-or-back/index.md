# "That is the question"

So it has been quite some time since I have sat down and had an inkling of time to to start up on some personal dev projects I had been wanting to make for a while.
After I finished up with my boot-camp, life consisted a lot of sprucing up old projects, applications, technical assessments, LeetCode problems (still absolutely abysmal at these) with a smattering of false starts on side projects.

There has been a project I've wanted to work on for a while that I feel I can start chipping away at now. It's also been some time since I've built something from the ground up, including a backend of it's own. I had even toyed around with the idea of learning Swift development and building it there, as I think it would make a great mobile app as well. I am still not entirely opposed to that idea, but figured I should hone in on my webdev skills first before diving into something completely new.

Anyway, back to my thought process. I am actually really enjoying this early phase of fleshing out some wire frames and such for the app. The one thing however I am kind of torn on is what to actually build first.

You can read the countless blog posts and comments on StackOverflow across the internet where you pros and cons to either or. What I have decided for myself, for this specific project only since I don't forsee it scaling to incredible lengths as the target users would be a pretty niche group is work on a feature based guideline as opposed to going all in and one or the other first.

This way I can build a section of my app that I need, code the front and backend in tandem for that specific feature set and build out from there. This way you know exactly what data and API's to write are needed for that one area, and you can build on that area to accommodate and have them play off each other rather than needing to to a complete revamp of one or the other.

I will certainly be chronicling this journey along the way, making sure to notate any pitfalls or successes I have building out a full-stack application in this manner.

Until next time,
Pete
